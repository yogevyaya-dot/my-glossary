**Web Accessibility** ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.

## Who benefits?
* People with visual impairments (blindness, low vision).
* People with motor impairments (inability to use a mouse).
* People with auditory impairments (deafness).
* People with cognitive disabilities.
* **Everyone:** Accessibility helps older people, people with slow internet, or those using devices in bright sunlight.

## Key Principles (POUR)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are organized around four principles:
1.  **Perceivable:** Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for images).
2.  **Operable:** UI components must be operable (e.g., keyboard navigation).
3.  **Understandable:** Information and operation of UI must be understandable.
4.  **Robust:** Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Is web accessibility a legal requirement?**
In many countries (including the US, EU, and Israel), yes. Websites providing public services or commerce must comply with accessibility standards (like WCAG 2.1) by law.

**2. What is a Screen Reader?**
Software used by blind or visually impaired people to read the content of a computer screen aloud. Popular examples include NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.

**3. Does accessibility hurt the design?**
No. Accessible design is simply good design. High contrast, clear fonts, and logical layouts improve the experience for *all* users, not just those with disabilities.

**4. What is ARIA?**
Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to describe their purpose to screen readers (e.g., telling a user that a `div` functions as a `button`).

**5. How can I test my website for accessibility?**
You can use automated tools like Google Lighthouse, WAVE, or axe. However, manual testing with a keyboard and a screen reader is essential for full compliance.
