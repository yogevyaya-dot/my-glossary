**API** stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications. Essentially, it allows different computer programs to talk to each other.

## How APIs Work
Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant. You (the user) sit at the table with a menu of choices, and the kitchen (the system) is the part that prepares your order. You don't need to know how the kitchen works; you just need the waiter to take your order and bring you the food.

* **Request:** The app sends a request to the server asking for data.
* **Response:** The server processes the request and sends back the appropriate information.
* **Endpoints:** Specific addresses where requests are sent.

## Common Types of APIs
There are several types of APIs used in web development today:

* **REST (Representational State Transfer):** The most common architectural style for web APIs.
* **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):** A protocol that uses XML for message exchange.
* **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
