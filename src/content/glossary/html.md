**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

## The DOM Structure
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.

## Key Elements
* **Tags:** HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.
* **Attributes:** Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements (e.g., `href` in links or `src` in images).
* **Semantic HTML:** Using elements for their given purpose (e.g., using `<article>` for an article instead of a generic `<div>`), which is crucial for SEO and Accessibility.

## Relationship with CSS and JS
While HTML provides the structure, CSS provides the style/visual layout, and JavaScript provides the interactivity.
