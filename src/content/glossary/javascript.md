**JavaScript** (often abbreviated as JS) is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

## Core Features
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.

* **Dynamic Typing:** You don't need to specify data types for variables; the engine figures it out at runtime.
* **Prototype-based Object-orientation:** Unlike class-based languages (like Java), JS uses prototypes for inheritance.
* **First-class Functions:** Functions are treated like any other variable (can be passed as arguments, returned by other functions).

## Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
Modern JS development often involves features introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later:
* **Arrow Functions:** A shorter syntax for writing function expressions.
* **Promises & Async/Await:** Syntactic sugar for handling asynchronous operations cleanly.
* **Modules:** Utilizing `import` and `export` to manage code structure.
