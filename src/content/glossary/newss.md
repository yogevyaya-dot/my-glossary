---\ntitle: \\ndescription: \NaN\n---\n\n**API** (Application Programming Interface) acts as an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, and the conventions to follow.\n\n## Key Concepts\nAPIs allow developers to save time by leveraging existing platforms rather than building from scratch.\n\n* **Endpoints:** Specific URLs where an API receives requests.\n* **Requests:** The act of asking the API for data or to perform an action.\n* **Responses:** The data returned by the API after a request.\n\n## Types of APIs\nThere are several ways APIs can work, depending on when and how they were created.\n\n* **REST:** Representational State Transfer. Uses standard HTTP methods.\n* **SOAP:** Simple Object Access Protocol. A protocol that uses XML for messaging.\n* **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly what they need.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*1. What is an API Key?*\nA unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.\n\n*2. Is an API the same as a server?*\nNo. The server hosts the application/database. The API is the door that lets you access specific parts of that server.\
