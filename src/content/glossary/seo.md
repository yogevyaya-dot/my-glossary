**SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is the art and science of persuading search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo to recommend your content to their users as the best solution to their problem.

## Core Pillars of SEO
SEO is generally divided into three main categories:
1.  **On-Page SEO:** Content optimization, keyword research, header tags (H1-H6), meta descriptions, and image alt text.
2.  **Off-Page SEO:** Activities outside the website, primarily building backlinks (citations) from other reputable sites to build authority.
3.  **Technical SEO:** Improving the backend structure, site speed, mobile-friendliness, indexing, and crawling efficiency.

## How Search Engines Work
Search engines use "crawlers" or "spiders" to scan the web. They follow links from one page to another, indexing the content they find. Algorithms then analyze this index to determine the most relevant results for a user's search query based on hundreds of ranking factors.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. How long does it take to see results from SEO?**
SEO is a long-term strategy. Typically, it takes 3 to 6 months to start seeing significant movement in rankings, and 6 to 12 months for substantial traffic growth.

**2. Can I do SEO myself or do I need an agency?**
You can definitely do the basics yourself (content, titles, speed). However, for competitive keywords and advanced technical issues, professional help or deep learning is often required.

**3. Are keywords still important?**
Yes, but their usage has evolved. Keyword stuffing (repeating words) is penalized. Today, it's about "search intent" and using keywords naturally within high-quality content.

**4. What is the difference between SEO and SEM?**
SEO focuses on organic (unpaid) traffic. SEM (Search Engine Marketing) includes SEO but primarily focuses on paid traffic (PPC) like Google Ads.

**5. Does social media affect SEO directly?**
No, social media signals (likes, shares) are not a direct ranking factor for Google. However, social media increases visibility, which leads to more traffic and potential backlinks, indirectly boosting SEO.
